# QIO

Command Line Interface for RainbowQ

Currently uses Cobra as a framework to load rainbow.toml, the default data format for the RainbowQ almanac system.

## Almanac System

RainbowQ is a new way to think about data.

It uses an Almanac: a collection of data around a particular topic that only exists within the context of its connections.

The Almanac structure in RainbowQ is analogous to a database table.
